Checks whether verification succeeds when a formal parameter pointer outside
of the assigns clause is assigned after being pointed at the location of a
member of a sub-struct of a freshly allocated struct before being assigned.
This is meant to show that all contained members (and their contained members)
of assignable structs are valid to assign.
